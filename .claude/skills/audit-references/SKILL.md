  and checks whether the claims made in the citing text are supported by the

# Audit references (citation verification)

This skill verifies that the citations in a document actually say what the
author claims they say. It complements `update-references` (which discovers
new papers) by auditing existing citations for correctness.

The output is an audit report: one entry per citation, with a verdict
(supported, unsupported, misattributed, not-found) and the evidence from the
source paper.

## Where things live

- **Document:** The markdown file the user points you at, or the most obvious
  draft in the working directory. Look for `.md` files that contain `[@`
  citations.
- **Database:** `references.yaml` in the working directory (or at the nearest
  ancestor that has one). This is the CSL-YAML bibliography that pandoc and
  `update-references` both use.
- **PDFs/papers:** `<db-dir>/pdfs/` and `<db-dir>/papers/` — the same locations
  `update-references` uses. If a paper was already fetched, reuse its markdown.
- **Audit report:** `<db-dir>/audits/<document-stem>-audit.md`, using the
  template in `<skill>/references/audit-template.md`.

## Prerequisites

The document must use pandoc citation syntax: `[@citation-id]`, `[@id1; @id2]`,
or `@citation-id` inline. The citation ids must match entries in
`references.yaml`.

If `references.yaml` does not exist in the paper directory, stop and tell the
user. They need to create it first (using `update-references` or manually).

## The workflow

### 1. Extract citations

Run the extraction script to get every citation and its surrounding context:

```bash
python3 <skill>/scripts/extract_citations.py <document-path>
```

This outputs a JSON array of objects, each with:
- `citation_id`: the pandoc citation key
- `context`: the sentence or paragraph surrounding the citation
- `line`: the line number in the source document
- `claim`: a best-effort extraction of the claim being made (the sentence
  containing the citation)

Review the output. If the document has no citations, report that and stop.

### 2. Resolve against references.yaml

Load `references.yaml` and match each `citation_id` to an entry. Classify each
citation:

- **resolved**: the id matches an entry in `references.yaml`
- **unresolved**: no matching entry — flag this immediately in the report

For resolved citations, note the entry's `arxiv_id` (if present), `URL`,
`title`, and `author` fields. These are needed to fetch the paper.

### 3. Fetch and read cited papers

For each resolved citation, get the paper text:

1. **Already fetched?** Check if `md_path` (or legacy `text_path`) or `pdf_path`
   exists in the database entry and the file is on disk. If so, read the
   markdown file directly. If only a PDF exists without markdown, run `repair`
   first to generate it.

2. **Has arxiv_id?** Fetch via the sibling skill's script:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/update-references/scripts/arxiv.py \
     --db <db-path> fetch --id <arxiv_id>
   ```
   Then read the markdown conversion it produces.

3. **No arxiv_id?** Search Google Scholar for the title:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/update-references/scripts/scholar.py \
     --db <db-path> search --query "<paper title>" --max 3
   ```
   If a match is found with a PDF link, fetch it:
   ```bash
   python3 .claude/skills/update-references/scripts/scholar.py \
     --db <db-path> fetch --title "<title>" --url "<pdf_url>" \
     --authors "Given Family" --year YYYY
   ```

4. **Cannot fetch?** Mark the citation as `not-found` in the report and move on.

### 4. Verify claims

For each citation where you have the paper text, read the relevant sections and
evaluate the claim made in the citing document:

- **supported**: the source paper contains evidence that backs the claim.
  Quote the relevant passage (one or two sentences).
- **unsupported**: the source paper does not contain evidence for the claim.
  Explain what the paper actually says about the topic.
- **misattributed**: the claim is true but attributed to the wrong source, or
  the source says something different from what is claimed. Explain the
  discrepancy.
- **not-found**: the paper could not be located or accessed.

Be precise. A claim like "Smith et al. show 30% improvement" requires finding
that specific number in the source. A paraphrase like "Smith et al. demonstrate
significant gains" needs the source to actually demonstrate gains in the claimed
domain.

### 5. Write the audit report

Use the template at `<skill>/references/audit-template.md`. Write the report to
`<db-dir>/audits/<document-stem>-audit.md`.

### 6. Report back

Summarize the results:
- Total citations found
- How many resolved vs. unresolved
- Verdicts: N supported, N unsupported, N misattributed, N not-found
- Call out any unsupported or misattributed citations explicitly — these need
  the author's attention

## Dependencies

Same as `update-references`: PyYAML is required, `pymupdf4llm` is recommended
for PDF-to-markdown conversion. The extraction script is pure Python stdlib.
arXiv and Scholar access use the sibling skill's scripts.
